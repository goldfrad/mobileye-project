## `Phase 1`
* Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized high- and low-pass filters.

## `Phase 2`
* Generating and training CNN using the products of the previous stage as input,
 to conclude all the traffic lights in the image (using tensorflow).

## `Phase 3`
* Estimating the distance to each detected traffic light from the camera picturing the images of interest,
 involving geometric and linear algebra calculations.
